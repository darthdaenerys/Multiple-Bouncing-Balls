# Multiple-Bouncing-Balls

This repository does the same thing as the previous one but now there are two balls and additional effects like glow, trail and sound has been added.

When the two balls collides, the frame stops for a short moment and you'll hear a beep sound. Also the model has been made completely parameterized. You may tweek the values and change almost any parameter.
